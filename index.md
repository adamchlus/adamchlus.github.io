I'm currently a PhD student in the Environmental Spectroscopy Lab (ENSPEC) in the Department of
Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin. I'm researching how light interacts
with vegetation and how relationships derived from those interactions can be used to monitor and
measure ecosystems at multiple scales (leaf, suborbital and space). I use a variety of tools in my
reseach including field spectrometers, airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers and LiDAR. I
also have an interest in electronics and optics, and as a hobby Iâ€™m working on developing
open-source, low cost sensors for measuring light that can be used for ecological research and
environmental monitoring.
