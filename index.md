I'm currently a postdoc at Jet Propulsion Laboratory where I am developing and implementing
algorithm workflows for generating higher-level products from airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data.
Previously, I was a PhD student in the Environmental Spectroscopy Lab (ENSPEC) at the University of Wisconsin
where researched how light interacts with vegetation and how relationships derived from those interactions can be used to monitor and measure
ecosystems at multiple scales (leaf, suborbital and space). I use a variety of tools in my research
including [field spectrometers](/research/#leaf-level-spectroscopy),
[airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers](/research/#imaging-spectroscopy)
and [lidar](/research/#lidar). Along the way I have also designed and built custom tools for
[collecting samples and making measurements](/research/#tools)
and [processing data](/research/#software).

I also have an interest in electronics and optics, and as a hobby Iâ€™m working on developing
[open-source, low cost sensors](/projects/) for measuring light that can be used for ecological research and
environmental monitoring.
