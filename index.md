I'm currently a PhD student in the Environmental Spectroscopy Lab (ENSPEC) in the Department of
Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin. I'm researching how light interacts with
vegetation and how relationships derived from those interactions can be used to monitor and measure
ecosystems at multiple scales (leaf, suborbital and space). I use a variety of tools in my reseach
including [field spectrometers](/research/#leaf-level-spectroscopy),
[airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers](/research/#imaging-spectroscopy)
and [LiDAR](/research/#lidar). My research has also required me to design and build custom tools for
[collecting samples and making measurements](/research/#tools)
and [processing data](/research/#software).

I also have an interest in electronics and optics, and as a hobby Iâ€™m working on developing
[open-source, low cost sensors](/projects/) for measuring light that can be used for ecological research and
environmental monitoring.
