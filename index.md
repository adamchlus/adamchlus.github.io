I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin in Phil Townsend's Environmental
Spectroscopy Lab (ENSPEC). I'm researching how light interacts with vegetation
and how relationships derived from those interactions can be used to monitor and measure ecosystems
at multiple scales (leaf, suborbital and space). I use a variety of tools in my reseach including field
spectrometers, airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers and LiDAR. I also have an interest in electronics and
optics, and as a hobby I’m working on developing open-source, low cost sensors for measuring light
that can be used for ecological research and environmental monitoring.
