career-profile:
    title: Adam Chlus
    summary: |
      I’m a technologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where I am developing and implementing algorithm workflows
      for airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data. I also use remote sensing data to
      monitor and measure important ecological properties. I use a variety of tools in my 
      research including field spectrometers, airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers and lidar. Along the way I have also designed and built 
      custom tools for collecting samples, making measurements and processing data.
