# Leaf level spectroscopy  
Leaf-level chemometric spectroscopy is a non-destuctive method for rapidly characterizing the
chemical content of leaves (ex: nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, sugars). **I'm investigating
how the relationships between spectra and chemistry change through time and across plant types
to develop more robust predictive models.**

# Imaging spectroscopy
In the same way that leaf-level spectroscopy can be used to estimate a number of biochemical
properties of individual leaves, imaging spectroscopy can be used to estimate foliar biochemistry across
landscapes. **I'm using a combination of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data
to research the inter- and intra-annual drivers of canopy biochemistry.** This work has involved combining
over 27 years of imagery from multiple instruments and required the development of custom radiometric, geometric
and atmospheric correction routines.

# LiDAR
Imagers are mostly limited to seeing the top of the canopy but foliar biochemistry also varies
through the vertical profile of the canopy, driven largely by within-canopy environmental
gradients. **Using imaging spectroscopy to map top-of-canopy biochemistry and LiDAR to model the
within-canopy light environment I'm developing methods to map canopy biochemistry in 3 dimensions.**

# Software
Whenever I can I use open-source software in my reseach and rely heavily on Python for most data analyses. In cases
where open-source software isn't available I develop my own, here are a few examples: 

- [HyTools](https://github.com/EnSpec/HyTools-sandbox) : Collaborative effort with other members of the ENSPEC lab to
  develop tools for processing imaging spectoscopy data  
- [pypwaves](https://github.com/adamchlus/pypwaves) : Full waveform LiDAR reading and processing library  
- [specIO](https://github.com/adamchlus/specIO) : Field spectrometer data reader (ASD, OO, SE and SVC)  
- [specGUI](https://github.com/adamchlus/specGUI) : A browser based GUI for viewing spectra in real time
