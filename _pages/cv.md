## Research 
**University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI					              	          2015 – Present**  
  *Graduate Research Assistant*  
  - Investigating the use of field, airborne and spaceborne spectroscopy for estimating foliar chemical composition.  
  - Developing open source software for processing imaging spectroscopy and lidar remote sensing data.

**University of Connecticut, Avery Point, CT							2014 – 2015**  
  *Research Assistant*  
  - Conducted field work and research to investigate the use of multi- and hyperspectral remote
	sensing platforms for identifying and tracking floating aquatic vegetation.  
  - Developed methods for detecting algal blooms using a spaceborne hyperspectral imager.

**Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA								2014**  
  *Suborbital Radar Science Intern*
